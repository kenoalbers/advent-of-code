### Day 1
**Features:**
- Imperative programming

### Day 2
**Approach:**
- Compare every next two levels.
  - \[7 6 4 2 1\] -> 7 & 6 -> 6 & 4 -> ...
- Return False if a rule is broken.

**Features:**
- Functional programming
- Immutable and Deterministic functions
  - Functions have no side effects
  - No observable effects outside its scope
- Pipeline design pattern
  - Utilizing `compose` from `toolz`

### Day 3
**Approach:**
- Use a regular expression with capturing groups to extract pairs of numbers from the input.
- Parse the extracted values as integers.
- Multiply the pairs of numbers.
- Compute the sum of all resulting products.

**Features:**
- One-liner
- Regex with capturing groups
